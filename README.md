# Chaotic heteroclinic networks as models of switching behavior in biological systems



# Celegans_fps.m

**Celegans_fps.m** simulates dynamics for a simple heteroclinic network with two fixed points.

The two saddle fixed points in this simulation are located at $$(x,y) = (1,1) $$ and $$(x,y) = (-1,-1)$$.
