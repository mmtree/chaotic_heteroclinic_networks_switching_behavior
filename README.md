# Chaotic heteroclinic networks as models of switching behavior in biological systems



# Celegans_fps.m

**Celegans_fps.m** simulates dynamics for a simple heteroclinic network with two fixed points.

The two saddle fixed points in this simulation are located at $(x,y) = (1,1)$ and $(x,y) = (-1,-1)$. The heteroclinic orbits connect the stable and unstable manifolds of these fixed points.
