# Chaotic heteroclinic networks as models of switching behavior in biological systems



## Celegans_fps.m

**Celegans_fps.m** simulates dynamics for a simple heteroclinic network with two fixed points.

The two saddle fixed points in this simulation are located at $(x,y) = (1,1)$ and $(x,y) = (-1,-1)$. The heteroclinic orbits connect the stable and unstable manifolds of these fixed points. The weighting functions are used to weight the stable and unstable manifolds.

## Linderman_make_fig2.m

**Linderman_make_fig2.m** simulates dynamics for a heteroclinic network with eight fixed points.

## Nichols2017_make_fig.m

**Nichols2017_make_fig.m** simulates dynamics for a heteroclinic network with three fixed points and computes dwell times.
